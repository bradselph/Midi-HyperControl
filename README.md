## Universal Driver for M-Audio Axiom AIR with HyperControl (Go)

This repository hosts a Go-based project aimed at creating a universal driver for the now-discontinued M-Audio Axiom AIR MIDI keyboards, including support for the proprietary HyperControl protocol. The goal is to restore full functionality and seamless DAW integration for these MIDI controllers.
